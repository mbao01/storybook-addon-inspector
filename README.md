#### CSS Variables
- See all CSS custom properties (variables) applied to the element
- View the computed values of CSS variables
- Track variable inheritance and overrides

#### Real-time Updates

#### Framework Support
This addon works with all major frameworks supported by Storybook:
- React
- Vue

### Tips & Tricks

1. **Inspecting Nested Elements**
   - Hover over elements to see their computed styles
   - Click to select an element for detailed inspection
   - Use the element picker to select deeply nested elements

2. **Debugging CSS Variables**
   - Look for the CSS Variables section to see all custom properties
   - Track variable inheritance through the component tree
   - Identify overridden variables

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - The inspector updates in real-time, so it's perfect for debugging responsive designs
   - Use it to verify media query implementations
   - Check computed values across different viewport sizes

### Known Limitations

- Dynamic styles applied through JavaScript might not be immediately reflected
- Very large style sheets might impact performance

## Release Management

### Setup

This project is configured to use [auto](https://github.com/intuit/auto) for release management. It generates a changelog and pushes it to both GitHub and npm. Therefore, you need to configure access to both:

- [`NPM_TOKEN`](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-viewing-access-tokens#creating-access-tokens) Create a token with both _Read and Publish_ permissions.
- [`GH_TOKEN`](https://github.com/settings/tokens) Create a token with the `repo` scope.

Then open your `package.json` and edit the following fields:

- `name`
- `author`
- `repository`

#### Local

To use `auto` locally create a `.env` file at the root of your project and add your tokens to it:

```bash
GH_TOKEN=<value you just got from GitHub>
NPM_TOKEN=<value you just got from npm>
```

Lastly, **create labels on GitHub**. You'll use these labels in the future when making changes to the package.

```bash
pnpm dlx auto create-labels
```

If you check on GitHub, you'll now see a set of labels that `auto` would like you to use. Use these to tag future pull requests.

#### GitHub Actions

This template comes with GitHub actions already set up to publish your addon anytime someone pushes to your repository.

Go to `Settings > Secrets`, click `New repository secret`, and add your `NPM_TOKEN`.

### Creating a release

To create a release locally you can run the following command, otherwise the GitHub action will make the release for you.

```sh
pnpm release
```

That will:

- Build and package the addon code
- Bump the version
- Push a release to GitHub and npm
- Push a changelog to GitHub
